# Changes made in this version of the [Python Cowsay Module](https://github.com/VaasuDevanS/cowsay-python)
*You don't need to read this to setup the bot. This is just for legal things.*
You can find the cowsay-Module in the file [**cowsay2.py**](https://github.com/just-dev-creator/Cowsay-Discord-Bot/blob/main/cowsay2.py)
Following changes were made:
	- The print commands were moved to String return, so it can sent by the [main function](https://github.com/just-dev-creator/Cowsay-Discord-Bot/blob/main/main.py) via Discrd. 

Note: To find the exact changes, please compare these two files:
